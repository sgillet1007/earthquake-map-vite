# USGS Earthquake Data Map

With earthquakes in the news recently I thought it would be interesting to build a map to visualize earthquake data provided by the USGS.

This site uses:
* Vite (the de-facto successor to Create React App)
* React (JS framework for building UIs)
* Leaflet (an open-source mobile-friendly web mapping library)


This project is very much a work in progress.  I'm planning to make several improvements to it including a custom search panel for interacting with the USGS api, and adding depth visualization to the map or interactive pop ups on each earthquake.


# Live Demo

Live demo of this earthquake map is deployed [here](https://usgs-earthquake-map.netlify.app/).
